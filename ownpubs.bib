abstract="The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a black hole spacetime are the free, decaying oscillations of the spacetime, and are well understood in the case of Kerr black holes. We discuss a method for computing the QNMs of spacetimes which are slightly deformed from Kerr. We mention two example applications: the parametric, turbulent instability of scalar fields on a background which includes a gravitational QNM, and the shifts to the QNM frequencies of Kerr when the black hole is weakly charged. This method may be of use in studies of black holes which are deformed by external fields or are solutions to alternative theories of gravity.",
